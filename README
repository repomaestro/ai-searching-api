This Java API provides user to solve standard search problems by just 
defining the problem independent of methods used to solve it, by defining:
- The initial state.
- The objective function(s).
- The goal state.
- Optional set of heuristics.

One uses classes provided by this API to define the search problem as above, 
and use the algorithms supplied to solve the search problem.

This API tries to make the problem definition as verbose as possible, in an
attempt to give the user as freedom as possible, so that many search problems
can be defined and solved by just using this API.

More information regarding the use of this API is present in JavaDoc of the
main package 'com.github.repomaestro.searching', and classes provided by this
package.
